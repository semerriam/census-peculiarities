# Census Peculiarities (In-Progress)

Data publication and documentation for a project on states' reallocation of prisoner populations in the U.S. 2020 Census. 


## Project goal

To understand the differences between the original census counts and the ammended counts for states that reallocate prisoner residences to addresses before incarceration. 

## Project notes
### Notebooks

* [census_chaos.ipynb](analysis/census_chaos.ipynb) looks at the U.S. Census 2020 PL 94-171 data summary files for states at the block level compared to the states' ammended population files
* [NJ-adjusted-census-merged.ipynb](analysis/NJ-adjusted-census-merged.ipynb) merges New Jersey's 21 adjusted datasets for each county into one dataset for importing into the census_chaos notebook. 

### Data sources

* [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/): Many state census and ammended census files were imported with the hub's API
* Individual state redistricting sites
